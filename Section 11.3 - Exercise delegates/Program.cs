/*
Hands-on Delegates!

Create a public delegate that will be called OperationDelegate,
and will get two arguments with float type and return float as well;

Create 4 static public methods called Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide. 
All of them should get 2 arguments and return a float that corresponds to the result
of the performed operation;

Create a public static ApplyOperation method that gets 2 floats and one delegate 
and applies the operation to those values and returns the result as a float;
